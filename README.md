# DMRVD(dual-modal raster-vector dataset)
Among them, each modality image is in the 'master' branch.
#
We present the first deep-learning-based DMRVD for super-resolution-fusion-based terraced field vectorization extraction(TFVE). DMRVD provides cross-modal and cross-scale super-resolution features, enabling advanced applications in TFVE.
DMRVD covers a total area of approximately 22,441 km² across three regions: Tonglu county in Zhejiang province, Qiaojia county, Ludian county in Yunnan province, Wudu District, Xihe County of Gansu Province, Wangcang County, Yanting County, Cangxi County and Jiuzhaigou Valley Scenic and Historic Interest Area County of Sichuan Provinc, China with 1,9330 remotely sensed imageries, 1,9330 DEMs and 371,150 vectorized polygons.

Due to the large size of the dataset, please move to [Google Cloud](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11F39NBdd9E385U47Gd1DYaLMWlr1TlFz) to download the remaining portion of the dataset
#
The dataset can be partitioned into training, testing and validation sets as needed, according to specific requirements.
# Next Step
Stay informed, the ΩSFormer code will soon be released.
